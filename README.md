This analysis attempts to answer the question of whether OkCupid can reliably predict user religion from other user-inputted data. The business use case is to impute religion when users don't enter it manually, in order to help potential partners find each other based on similar spiritual beliefs. Scikit-learn ML methods include LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifer, with cross-validation. The data comes from a publicly-available dataset published in the Journal of Statistics Education, Volume 23, Number 2 (2015) by Albert Y. Kim et al.
